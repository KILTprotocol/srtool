== Build the Docker image

While you don't have to build the image yourself, you still may!

First you may want to double check what rustc versions are available as you will HAVE to build an image for a given version:

    rustup check

So say you want to build a builder for rustc {rsversion}:

    RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion} && docker build --build-arg RUSTC_VERSION=$RUSTC_VERSION -t {name}:$RUSTC_VERSION .
