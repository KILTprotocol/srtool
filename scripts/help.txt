Welcome to srtool: the Substrate Runtime Toolbox ðŸ§°

First of all, make sure you are in your Substrate/Polkadot repo:

    cd /my/project/substrate

Read the documentation at https://github.com/paritytech/srtool for more details.
You may use one of the following commands:
    $ export PACKAGE=kusama-runtime
    $ srtool version
    $ srtool info
    $ srtool build

The last one is when you can go grab a coffee.
