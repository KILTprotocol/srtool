Welcome to srtool: the Substrate Runtime Toolbox ðŸ§°

First of all, make sure you are in your Substrate/Polkadot repo:

    cd /my/project/substrate

Read the documentation at https://gitlab.com/chevdor/srtool
First set the srtool alias (see the README at the link above).

You may use one of the following commands:
    $ export PACKAGE=kusama-runtime 
    $ srtool version
    $ srtool info
    $ srtool build
    
The last one is when you can go grab a coffee.
