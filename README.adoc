= Substrate Runtime Toolbox: srtool

== Intro

srtool is a collection of dockerized tools helping with https://substrate.dev[Substrate] & https://polkadot.network[Polkadot] Runtime development.

It especially helps with building and verifying Wasm Runtime Blobs. 
  
The Docker image is `{name}`. You can find it at https://hub.docker.com/r/{name}.

== Install

=== Pull image

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    docker pull {name}:<version> # <1>
----

<1> where `<version>` is the rustc version you want to use.

...or just skip that step, the right image will be fetched at first run.

=== Using an alias    

Creating an alias helps hiding the docker complexity behind one simple command. We will see more powerful options but this one is simple enough.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=kusama-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:$RUSTC_VERSION'
----

NOTE: Note that defining the alias as done above will hardcode the runtime. Using `kusama-runtime` as show above means you will *always* check the kusama runtime. If you need more, check the next chapter. 

NOTE: If you want to check what your alias is, use `type srtool`

The command to invoke a build will then be `srtool build`.

=== Power users

If you want flexibility, using a *function* is slightly more complex but more flexible.

If you already defined an alias (you can check with `type srtool`), you should first unset it with `unlias srtool`.

NOTE: You cannot use both an alias and a function but you could make a function called fsrtool for instance for the function... 

==== Hardcoded compiler version

This option should be enough most of the time.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    function srtool() { docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:nightly-2019-12-07 $2; }
----

The commands to use srtool are then:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    srtool kusama-runtime build
----

NOTE: The <kusama-runtime> keyword above specifies we will check the kusama runtime. If your runtime is called xyz-runtime, swap accordingly.

==== Parametric compiler version

Using this version is more powerful if you know what you are doing but also requires more typing.

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    function srtool() { docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:$2 $3; }
----

The command to invoke a build will then be `srtool <package> <rust_version> build`. For instance:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    srtool my-super-runtime {rsversion} build
    srtool polkadot-runtime nightly-2019-12-05 build
----

WRNING: The second example is only there to illustrate how it works. If you try it today, it will likely *not* work as I did not build a container for this version yet.

You likely want to make this persistent with:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    echo "export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=polkadot-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:$RUSTC_VERSION'" >> ~/.bash_profile && source ~/.bash_profile
----

If you wish to see more (it takes a little longer), you may set the `VERBOSE` ENV variable:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    export RUSTC_VERSION={rsversion}; export PACKAGE=polkadot-runtime; alias srtool='docker run --rm -it -e PACKAGE=$PACKAGE -e VERBOSE=1 -v $PWD:/build -v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home chevdor/srtool:$RUSTC_VERSION'
----

NOTE: The part `-v /tmp/cargo:/cargo-home` exposes the docker container's cargo cache on your local machine. This helps making subsequent builds faster.

== Use

Now that you defined the srtool alias, you can use it as shown below:

.See the help
    srtool help

.Build the runtime
    srtool build

.Typical run

Invoking `srtool build` with:

    $ srtool build

Looks like this:

.JSON output

You might find it more convenient to produce a json output, this is simple:

    $ srtool build --json

.Advanced usage
if you feel fancy, you may also:

    srtool bash

and look around the /srtool folder

== Build the Docker image

While you don't have to build the image yourself, you still may!

First you may want to double check what rustc versions are available as you will HAVE to build an image for a given version:

    rustup check

So say you want to build a builder for rustc nightly-2019-12-07:

[subs="attributes+"]
----
    RUSTC_VERSION=nightly-2019-12-07 && docker build --build-arg RUSTC_VERSION=$RUSTC_VERSION -t chevdor/srtool:$RUSTC_VERSION .
